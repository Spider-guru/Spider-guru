- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full-stack web developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript at the moment, html and css aren't actually programming languages so i'll leave that out.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to beginner projects, be it in web design or development of any kind.
- 📫 You can reach in the following handles: preciousgodwin559@gmail.com. yeah for now I'll add more details soon.
